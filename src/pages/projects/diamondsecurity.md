This website was built to cater for a security company using [Astro](https://astro.build/ "Astro"). I thoroughly enjoyed the building process and used it to delve further into the documentation of the web framework.

The client initally requested a single-page site with some key details of their services, but later a contact page with a form connected to Netlify was added.

I experimented with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/ "Tailwind") and added [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/ "SASS") to the stack to accelerate the process of designing the site. This was my first time using Tailwind. I found it to be a useful tool for quickly structuring a page and allowing for more focus on functionality. SASS is a scripting language that I am very familiar with and enjoy the organised structure of its indented syntax.

Throughout this project, I learnt to implement layouts, components and frontmatter to enhance functionality. By using layout and component files, I was able to reduce duplication by encapsulating head, navigation and footer code. In addition, a _card_ component was used to effectively produce the 'services' data objects.

This site was built with speed and efficiency in mind. It scores 100% in the four categories of performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO in [Google's PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-diamondsecurity-co/fj17p8a2ak?form_factor=desktop "Google's PageSpeed Insights"). SEO was handled using frontmatter in the head component by including fields for a description, social image and canonical URL on each page. For accessibility, aria-labels, tab indexing and a 'skip to content' button were included. The [Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/ "WAVE") was used to ensure any errors relating to this were handled properly.
