At the time of build, I recieved the InDesign file, PDF and assets of the approved website design. Using our Silverstripe CMS core codebase, I recreated the design using HTML, SCSS, Javascript and PHP.

I particulary enjoyed building this site as the majority of our clients are education based and this project provided some unique challenges and features.

Alongside the homepage, the first level children involved creating their own page type. The event pages also required a specific page type. A number of dataobjects were also needed to achieve this design.
