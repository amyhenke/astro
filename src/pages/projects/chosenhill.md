This is a multi-homepage site in which the main school and sixth form have completely seperate areas of the website. As this is a feature that started to be regularly requested within the last couple of years, we have added this functionality into our core code base. This now requires a checkbox in the CMS to activate, reordering the navigation with the homepage as the parent to all the other pages within that section of the sitetree and setting the individual logos and taglines within each homepage.

As a team we have worked hard to ensure that our core code base is regularly and properly maintained. My coworker and lead developer Adam has done a fantastic job with this and we have worked in collaboration to ensure that everything is built in a managable, reusable and organised manner.

I am incredibly proud of the work we have been able to achieve over the last three years. We upgraded to the latest version of Silverstripe and rewrote the entire core to fit our specific use cases. It has been meticulously planned to ensure that we are working as efficiently as possible. This work has substantially reduced the number of support tickets and significantly improved our end projects.

This website was designed in house, as per usual. I was sent the finalised design to recreate in web form. This build consisted of quite a few home page modules including a _student of the week_ section which required an additional dataobject added with PHP. It also has a news module, instagram feed and upcoming events slider, to name a few.

The client wanted lazy loading throughout and animating lines to run as the user scrolls to add a more active feel to the page. Overall, I think this site turned out really nice and the client was very happy too.
